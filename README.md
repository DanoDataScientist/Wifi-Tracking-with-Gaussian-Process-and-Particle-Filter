# Wifi-Tracking-with-Gaussian-Process-and-Particle-Filter
- interface.py: simulation to plot the intensity of the wifi signal at five pre-set wifi access points
- particleFilter.py: final simulation to show the tracking effect on a simple map (containing the structure of an extenable map and motion model)
- GP3D.py: Gaussian Process training and plotting the gaussian surface
